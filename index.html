    <h2>The Story in the Book</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk., lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific jouranls her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
        the road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    <p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the
      secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had somthing better to do.</p>
