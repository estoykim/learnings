    <h1>Basics of Images in HTML</h1>
    <p>We will learn how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Include an image in your web pages using HTML</li>
      <li>Pick which image format to use</li>
      <li>Show an image at the right size</li>
      <li>Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adding background images can be done using CSS.</p>

    <p><b>TIP</b> When creating a webpage, it is a good practice to make a folder for all images used in your website.
      You can also add sub-folders for each type of images, such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF. </p>
    <p>To add image, use <em>img</em> element and make sure it has <em>src</em> attribute with correct location
      for the html file as the value.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>img attributes</h2>
    <p><b>src</b> - this is to locate the image file you want to appear on your site.
      You can use <em>relative URLs</em> in locating the image file of your site.</p>
    <p><b>alt</b> - if the image fails to appear on the website, it is a good customary to
      use this attribute to descript what's on the image.</p>
    <p><b>title</b> - use this to put a description on the image. This appears when hovering
      your mouse on the image.</p>
    <p><b>height</b> and <b>width</b> - this is to configure the dimensions of your image\
      on your site. If you want to change it relative to height or width, just assign a value
      for either height or width only.
      <hr>
    <h2>Three Rules for Creating Images</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Save images in the right format</b> Browsers only accept image formats in the
        form of JPEG, GIF, or PNG.
      <li><b>Save images at the right size</b> Use the correct dimensions when using it on your
        website. For example, your source image is smaller than the dimensions you set as values
        on your height/weight attribute, the image on your website will appear as blurry. However,
        if the source image is larger than your set dimensions, it might load longer on your browser. </p>
      <li><b>Use the correct resolution</b> Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels.
        Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. <strong>Resolution</strong> refers to the
        number of dots per inch (or dpi). Most computer screens only show web pages at <strong>72 pixels</strong>
        per inch. Therefore, images with higher resolution will load longer.
    </ol>

    <h2>Image Formats</h2>
    <h3>JPEG (.jpg)</h3>
    <p>If your picture has different colors, use JPEG. Usually, it is used in photography.
      For example an overcast sky might not look like it has large areas that are just white or gray, but the picture
      is usually made up of many different colors that are subtly different.</p>
    <p>Example of image used for web page in JPEG format</p>
    <a href="../images/JPEG_sample_picture.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/JPEG_sample_picture.jpg" title="A sample picture as a JPEG format" alt="Image of a scenery." height="200"></a>
    <h3>PNG (.png) and GIF (.gif)</h3>
    <p>If you are using flat images, meaning images with less colors, then use PNG or GIF.
      Logos, illustrations, and infographics are usually called flat images.</p>
    <p>Example of flat image (or flat design) used for a web page that is in PNG format</p>
    <a href="../images/flat-design.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/flat-design.png" title="A sample picture as a PNG format" alt="Flat design" height="200"></a>
    <hr>
    <h2>Image Resolution</h2>
    <p>Images created for the web should be saved at <strong>a resolution of 72 ppi</strong>. The higher the resolution of the image, the lager the size of the file.
      JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to a type of image format known as <strong>bit map</strong>. They are made up of <strong>resolution</strong> of an image is the number of squares
      that fit within 1 inch x 1 inch square area.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Images appearing on <strong>computer</strong> screens are made of tiny squares called <strong>pixels</strong>. The web browsers on most desktop
      computers display images at a resolution of <strong>72</strong> pixels per inch (ppi). Images in <strong>print</strong> materials (such as books and magazines)
      are made up of tiny circles called <strong>dots</strong>. These images are usually printed at a resolution of <strong>300</strong> dots per inch (dpi).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher resolution is not always a good thing when including in your web pages. Too large of resolution may cause your web page to load longer.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Always remember that computers are capped to <strong>72 ppi</strong> display.</em>

    <hr>
    <h2>Vector Images</h2>
    <p>Vector images differ from <strong>bitmap</strong> images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as
      Adobe Illustrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flat design is a sample of a vector image that is created in Adoble Illustrator.
    </p>
    <a href="../images/vector-image.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/vector-image.png" alt="A sample of a vector image." title="Sample Vector Image" height="200"></a>
    <hr />
    <h2>Animated GIFs</h2>
    <p>
      These shows several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
    </p>
    <a href="../images/spongebob.gif" target="_blank"><img src="../images/spongebob.gif" alt="A sample of a GIF file." title="Sample GIF File" height="150"></a>

    <h2>Figure and Figure Caption</h2>
    <h3>Figure Element</h3>
    <p>Usually, images comes with captions. Lately, HTML5 added a new
    HTML tag which is called the figure element. This element
    contains images and their caption so that the two are associated.
    </p>
    <h3>Figcaption Element</h3>
    <p>
    Figcaption element is the element that makes the caption to
    the image possible. The content of this element contains the
    caption to the image.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the example of <strong>Figure</strong> and <strong>Figcaption</strong> element.</p>
    <figure>
       <a href="../images/pikachu-meme.jpg" target="_blank" height="200"><img src="../images/pikachu-meme.jpg" alt="HD Pikachu Meme" title="Pikachu Meme"></a>

       <figcaption><b>Figure:</b> An image of Pikachu Meme in HD.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The figure contains <strong>img element</strong> and if you want,
       you can also add a direct link for its image source. To do that,
       you add <strong>a href element</strong> and contain the <strong>img element</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>After the figure element, follows the <strong>figcaption element</strong>. This contains the
       caption for the image.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Combination of Image Element and Table Element</h2>
    <table cellspacing="20">
      <tr>
        <td><p align="right">
          <b>Figure:</b> Here's the caption for the picture. Can you believe it?
          He's an electrical engineer that became famous for his picture. We can
          align the paragraph to the right by adding align attribute inside the paragraph
          element.
        </p>
        <p align="left">We can also add another paragraph inside a cell if we want to. For practice
          purposes, we can also align the paragraph to the left. Same with what we did above.
        Are we good? Great! Now let's join Harold with his coffee.</p></td>
        <td><a href="../images/hide-the-pain-harold.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/hide-the-pain-harold.jpg" alt="Hide the pain, Harold Meme" title="Hide your pain, Harold!" height="200"></a></td>
